# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

# The way I can ensure my software is functional and secure is to continually and thoroughly test all of the components to make sure that everything is functional and that there are no vulnerabilities.  I can always run a Maven build with the program to check for any new vulnerabilities that occur, and this should be done when updating the software.  As a tester, we always need to look for failures and vulnerabilities withouy any bias.  This meant to leave no stone unturned and to actively seek failures or errors in the code.  If there are none, then we know we have functional and secure software.  

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

# The way I have been taught to interpet and incoporate user needs was to collect the user requirements from the client and then analyze them to create the user stories.  From there, we protoritze the user stories on the board by the highest priority first, then those stories of the lowest proroty last.  We continue to develop and test the components using the Scrum method and then work together and comunicate as a team, as well as contiunally communicating with the client.  Then when all of the components are completed, we test them together to make sure everything is integrated correctly with no errors or bugs.  If things are all correct and the client has postive feedback, then the program is ready for deployment and maintenance when needed.  

# How do I approach designing software?

# There are a couple of ways I learned to approach designing software.  One would be the function-oriented approach.  This is where the focus would be on how we would want the software to function, and then to focus on the sub-functions of these functions.  The other way would be using a object-oriented, which would be to focus on the entities that are associated with the functions of the sofware.
